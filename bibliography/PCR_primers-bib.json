  {"id":"chesterDimethylSulfoxideMediatedPrimer1993","abstract":"We report a method for optimizing the specificity of product formation in the polymerase chain reaction (PCR). This technique is based on the use of dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) and takes into account primer Tm. The reduction in Tm by DMSO is directly correlated with renaturation temperature such that a DMSO gradient reflects a temperature gradient. We use this relationship to show that optimum product formation usually occurs at or within several degrees of the midpoint Tm of a given primer pair. We illustrate these correlations using three examples deriving PCR products from a human cDNA library, representing the casein kinase II α and β subunits as well as the 5′ untranslated region for the β subunit. By following product formation as a function of renaturation temperature, we postulate rules for cycle design based on primer Tm. Implications for the use of degenerate primers are discussed.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2022,10,9]]},"author":[{"family":"Chester","given":"N."},{"family":"Marshak","given":"D.

  {"id":"MARMUR1962109","abstract":"The previously discovered linear relation between the base composition of DNA, expressed in terms of percentage of guanine plus cytosine bases, and the denaturation temperature, Tm, has been further investigated. By means of measurements on 41 samples of known base composition the previously observed relation has been confirmed. It can be summarized thus : for a solvent containing 0·2 M-Na+, Tm = 69·3 + 0·41 (G-C) where Tm is in degrees Centigrade and G-C refers to the mole percentage of guanine plus cytosine. The deviations of experimental points from this relation are no more than that expected from the uncertainties of base analysis and the variations of a half degree in the reproducibility of determining the Tm. Consequently it appears that the measurement of the Tm is a satisfactory means of determining base composition in DNA. The Tm values are most simply measured by following the absorbance at 260 mμ as a function of temperature of the DNA solution and noting the midpoint of the hyperchromic rise. Only 10 to 50 μg of DNA are required. A number of other DNA samples of unknown base composition have been examined in this manner and their base compositions recorded.","author":[{"family":"Marmur","given":"J."},{"family":"Doty","given":"P."}],"citation-key":"MARMUR1962109","container-title":"Journal of Molecular Biology","DOI":"https://doi.org/10.1016/S0022-2836(62)80066-7","ISSN":"0022-2836","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[[1962]]},"page":"109-118","title":"Determination of the base composition of deoxyribonucleic acid from its thermal denaturation temperature","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0022283662800667","volume":"5"},

  {"id":"schildkrautDependenceMeltingTemperature1965","abstract":"Data on the decrease of the DNA melting temperature Tm with the salt concentration M are reported and discussed. The electrostatic free energy change in the helix–coil transition, ΔFe is related to the potential, ψ, which represents the electrostatic repulsion between the phosphate charges; ψ is calculated as a function of M and of the distances between the charges of the two strands. The Debye-Hückel approximation is shown to overestimate ψ. It is suggested that the high local concentration of the counterions in the immediate vicinity of the fixed charges screen these charges from interacting with other fixed charges, to the extent that the system behaves as if the fixed ions carry a reduced charge. The notion of a reduced charge represents in a single parameter the deviation of the Debye-Hückel approximation from the true potential. A plot of Tm versus ΔFe gives a straight line as predicted. ΔH0 is calculated from the slope and found to be consistent with experimentally determined values. Our calculations support the hypothesis that the change of Tm with salt concentration is due to changes in the screened interactions between the fixed phosphate charges. In analyzing the results of these calculations, we are able on the one hand to indicate some of the limitations of the theoretical model and, on the other hand, draw some conclusions about the order of magnitude of the nonelectrostatic interaction energy of formation of the double helix.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2022,10,9]]},"author":[{"family":"Schildkraut","given":"Carl"},{"family":"Lifson","given":"Shneior"}],"citation-key":"schildkrautDependenceMeltingTemperature1965","container-title":"Biopolymers","DOI":"10.1002/bip.360030207","ISSN":"1097-0282","issue":"2","issued":{"date-parts":[[1965]]},"language":"de","note":"_eprint: https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1002/bip.360030207","page":"195-208","source":"Wiley Online Library","title":"Dependence of the melting temperature of DNA on salt concentration","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/bip.360030207","volume":"3"},

The oligomers, 11, 14, and 17 bases long, are complementary to the region of the DNA which accounts for the am-3 point mutation. When hybridized to am-3 DNA, the oligonucleotides form duplexes with a single base pair mismatch. The thermal stability of the duplexes formed between wt and am-3 DNAs has been measured. The am-3 DNA:oligomer duplexes dissociate at a temperature about 10 degrees C lower than the corresponding wt DNA:oligomer duplexes. This dramatic decrease in thermal stability due to a single mismatch makes it possible to eliminate the formation of the mismatched duplexes by the appropriate choice of hybridization temperature. These results are discussed with respect to the use of oligonucleotides as probes for the isolation of specific cloned DNA sequences.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2022,10,9]]},"author":[{"family":"Wallace","given":"R B"},{"family":"Shaffer","given":"J"},{"family":"Murphy","given":"R F"},{"family":"Bonner","given":"J"},{"family":"Hirose","given":"T"},{"family":"Itakura","given":"K"}],"citation-key":"wallaceHybridizationSyntheticOligodeoxyribonucleotides1979","container-title":"Nucleic Acids Research","container-title-short":"Nucleic Acids Res","ISSN":"0305-1048","issue":"11","issued":{"date-parts":[[1979,8,10]]},"page":"3543-3557","PMCID":"PMC327955","PMID":"158748","source":"PubMed Central","title":"Hybridization of synthetic oligodeoxyribonucleotides to phi chi 174 DNA: the effect of single base pair mismatch.","title-short":"Hybridization of synthetic oligodeoxyribonucleotides to phi chi 174 DNA","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC327955/","volume":"6"},
